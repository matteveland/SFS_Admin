# SFS Admin

SFS Admin is a project I stated when I began learning to progam. Over the years I have tinkered and modified the following site to become what it currently is.  Feel free to try at https://demo.sfsadmin.com/homepage.php. <br>

Users are seperated between admin and non_admin. There are additional permissions seperated by sections and can be added to each individual. 

You can add a new unit at the following link: https://demo.sfsadmin.com/resources/Admin/Set-up/1-set-up-unit-name.php
